## [2.1.7]

### Added
- **Model display fallback**: Fill readable names for common model IDs when `displayName` is missing.

### Changed
- **Message flow**: Message/Retry flow now hooks into the account refresh service for consistent state updates.

## [2.1.6]

### Added
- **Unified quota refresh entry**: Sidebar, accounts overview, and auto refresh now flow through `QuotaRefreshManager` for consistent behavior.

### Improved
- **Shared file cache**: Batch and auto refresh use the 60-second file cache to prevent duplicate requests across IDEs/workspaces.
- **Auto refresh jitter**: Added randomized offset (>=30s: -10~+10s; <30s: 0~+10s) to reduce synchronized spikes.
- **Dashboard refresh**: In authorized mode, refreshes only the active account via real-time request path.

### Fixed
- **Force refresh**: Concurrent waits no longer fall back to cache, ensuring single-account refresh stays real-time.
- **Copy consistency**: Cached time labels now use i18n strings.

## [1.8.39]

### Fixed
- **Race Conditions**: Fixed multiple account operations (delete, switch, import) executing concurrently causing inconsistent state.
  - Added account operation mutex lock to ensure serialized execution
  - Fixed startup account sync racing with user-initiated operations
  - Fixed deleted accounts being auto-reimported during quota refresh (added auto-import blacklist mechanism)
- **Account Switching**: Fixed auto-switch logic still detecting Antigravity Tools accounts.

### Changed
- **Account Switching**: Account switching now **follows local Antigravity client only** (`state.vscdb`), no longer detects Antigravity Tools.
  - Startup automatically syncs to local client's current login (silent import and switch)
  - "Switch to Current Login" button only detects local client
- **Antigravity Tools Sync**: Auto-sync feature now **only imports accounts, no longer auto-switches**.
- **UI**: Removed the "Auto Switch Account" checkbox and related descriptions from the "Account Sync Settings" modal.

## [1.8.38]

### Fixed
- **UI Consistency**: Fixed a script error in the Dashboard where switching quota sources would freeze the UI due to a missing function call.
- **Offline Sync**: Fixed a state synchronization issue where the correct quota source wasn't displayed in the frontend when the extension was offline.

### Changed
- **Account Switching**: Significant logic rewrite for account switching. The extension now prioritizes detecting the active account in the local Antigravity client (`state.vscdb`) over Antigravity Tools, with robust fallbacks.
- **Account Switching**: Quota data is now immediately refreshed after switching accounts in all modes (authorized/local).
- **Account Switching**: Improved the "Switch to Current Login" button logic to cross-detect accounts from multiple local sources.

### Engineering
- **Linting**: Enabled ESLint for all webview JavaScript files. Fixed dozens of "variable defined but never used" warnings and potential runtime errors.
- **Build**: Integrated ESLint into the build process; `npm run compile` now automatically performs code quality checks before building.

### i18n
- **Wording**: Updated the `alreadySynced` message across all 15 supported languages (e.g., "Already using this account, no switch needed") to be more accurate as it now covers multiple account sources.

## [1.8.37]

### Changed
- **Model Management**: The model manager and quota display now show only recommended models, filtering out non-recommended models (e.g., `chat_*`, `Gemini 2.5 Flash`).
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed the "Select Recommended" button from the model manager toolbar as it's no longer needed.
- **Announcements**: Added scrolling support for announcement popup content when content is too long.

## [1.8.36]

### Fixed
- **Windows Local Auth Import**: Fixed `spawn sqlite3 ENOENT` error on Windows when importing local accounts. Replaced system `sqlite3` command-line tool with pure JavaScript `sql.js` library for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Account Switching**: Fixed issue where manually switching accounts in the Manage Accounts modal would be reverted to the original account during quota refresh.

### Added
- **Switch to Current Login**: Added "Switch to Current Login" button on the authorized account row. Click to quickly sync to the account currently logged in on Antigravity Tools or the local client. If the account exists, it switches directly; if not, an import confirmation dialog appears.

## [1.8.35]

### Changed
- **Model Management**: Unified model management logic for local and authorized sources, ensuring a consistent experience across different quota origins.
- **Model Management**: Local mode now supports automatic sorting (weighted by recommended rank) and default selection of recommended models.
- **UI**: The "Select Recommended" button in the model manager is now always available regardless of the quota source.

## [1.8.34]

### Changed
- **Local Quota**: Optimized local quota fetching to prioritize remote API using local account credentials (from `state.vscdb`), with local process API as fallback. This improves data accuracy while maintaining compatibility.
- **Auto Import**: Local account credentials are now automatically imported to credential storage on first use, enabling seamless switching between local and authorized modes.
- **UI**: Hidden the "Plan" button by default and collapsed the Plan Details section.

### Added
- **Local Account Display**: Local mode now displays the current account email when using remote API.

## [1.8.33]

- **UI**: Refined sync config layout, button alignment, and copy for a more compact experience.

### Fixed
- **Authorized Quota**: Avoid stale quota updates after fast account removal/switching by clearing cache and dropping outdated results.
- **Windows Port Detection**: Use PowerShell `Get-NetTCPConnection` to avoid localized `LISTENING` parsing failures.

## [1.8.32]

### Changed

- **i18n**: Completed full translations for time window settings and account labels across all 14 supported languages.

## [1.8.1]

### Changed
- **Auto Wake-up**: Stream requests now capture full SSE payloads and record usage/traceId in trigger history; missing completion tokens default to 0, and output is capped at 8 tokens for wake pings.
- **Manual Test**: Model picker supports multi-select (defaults stay the same) and triggers run concurrently per selected model.
- **Networking**: Added a streaming helper with retry/backoff; auto wake-up uses it to fetch stream responses.

### Improved
- **Webview Management**: Implemented WebviewPanelSerializer to properly restore webview panel after extension reload, preventing orphan panels and ensuring the latest code is always used.

## [1.7.21]

### Fixed
- **Announcements**: Announcement language filtering now respects the manual language setting.

## [1.7.2]

### Added
- **Manual Language Setting**: Added a manual language selector in the Dashboard settings to override the default VS Code language.

### Changed
- **Authorized Quota**: Prefer Cloud Code production endpoint with sandbox fallback, and resolve project ID via loadCodeAssist with onboardUser fallback.
- **Auto Wake-up**: Use the same primary Cloud Code endpoint with fallback.
- **Logging**: Cloud Code request logs now include the full request URL for easier troubleshooting.
- **Reliability**: Authorized quota requests use retry/backoff and reuse cached data on transient failures.
- **Authorization**: Detect invalid refresh tokens explicitly and log clearer token states.
- **Cloud Code Client**: Unified request logic across authorized quota and auto wake-up with shared retry rules.
- **Error Handling**: Treat 403 as non-retryable to avoid noisy loops.

### Fixed
- **Loading State**: Fixed an issue where the loading screen would get stuck indefinitely during initial installation or when switching quota sources.

### Refactor
- **Configuration Persistence**: Migrated `quotaSource` setting to global state to resolve VS Code setting synchronization conflicts and write failures. Old configuration is automatically migrated and cleaned up.

## [1.7.0]

### Added
- **Authorized Quota Source**: Monitor quotas without a local process, sharing credentials with Auto Wake-up. Added source toggle UI and authorization status card.

- **Refresh**: Manual refresh cooldown reduced to 10 seconds.

### Fixed
- **Auto Wake-up**: Fixed scheduled trigger bug where only the first time point was triggered when multiple times with different minutes (e.g., `07:00`, `09:30`) were configured.
- **Auto Wake-up**: Fixed weekly mode multi-time bug, now supports multiple time points with different minutes.
- **Auto Wake-up**: Fixed status page mode display showing only the first time point, now shows all time points.
- **Authorized Monitoring**: Removed redundant prompt text when not authorized.

### Migration
- **Why**: Group/model personalization (order, pins, custom names, visibility) grew settings.json, created sync noise, and behaved more like per-device UI state.
- **What**: Move these UI preferences from settings to globalState (no cross-device sync), and clean up legacy settings. Removed list view and the `viewMode` setting.

## [1.6.15]

### Added
- **Auto Wake-up**: Wake on quota reset mode and trigger history now records the exact auto mode.
- **Auto Wake-up**: Custom wake word support for triggers and tests.
